# A-Primer-on-Transformers-in-Single-Cell-Genomics



This primer introduces the use of Transformers in the field of single-cell data analysis, specifically for cell type annotation. Originally designed for natural language processing (NLP), Transformers have been adapted to tackle complex patterns in high-dimensional biological data such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). This adaptation is promising for genomics because Transformers can effectively handle the sequential and complex nature of biological data, capturing dependencies and patterns that are crucial for accurate annotation.

This primer serves as a guide to applying a Transformer model to annotate single-cell data. It assumes the reader to be familiar with the main principles of single cell technology, the Python language and the functionalities of the [Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Anndata](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) packages.
