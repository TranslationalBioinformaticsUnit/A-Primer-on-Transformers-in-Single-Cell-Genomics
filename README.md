This repository supplements the manuscript **A Primer on Transformers in Single-Cell Genomics**. It is designed to introduce the application of Transformer models in the analysis of single-cell genomics data, particularly for cell type annotation.

## Background
Transformers, originally developed for tasks in natural language processing (NLP), have shown remarkable adaptability and success in analyzing complex patterns in high-dimensional biological datasets, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). By leveraging Transformers, researchers can effectively manage the sequential and intricate nature of biological data, which is pivotal for capturing essential dependencies and patterns crucial for precise cell type annotation.

## Learning Objectives
This primer provides:
- A comprehensive introduction to using Transformer models in single-cell genomics.
- Insights into how Transformers handle the complex data structure of scRNA-seq.
- Guidance on applying these models to annotate cell types accurately.

## Prerequisites
Readers should have a basic understanding of:
- Single-cell technology principles.
- Python programming.
- Functionality of [Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Anndata](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) packages.

## Tutorial
For a practical application of these concepts, refer to the tutorial available as:
- [Run the Notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14tMvT82icSNRZZKN-Z2BKGIRH5-RCMpK#scrollTo=BBhBkJffYg_b)

The primer has been tested on Linux and OS X platforms.

Feel free to explore the notebook, experiment with the code, and dive deeper into the transformative application of Transformers in genomics!
